# healthcare-project
The Healthcare Predictive Analytics project focuses on developing a predictive model to improve healthcare 
outcomes by providing data-driven insights. The model will be designed to help healthcare professionals 
with tasks such as patient risk prediction, trend identification in health metrics, and making informed 
decisions based on predictive analytics. The project will utilize machine learning models to forecast 
healthcare-related outcomes, focusing on improving patient care and resource management.

we are working on 2 levels: clinical level and managerial level, with about 8 datasets or more, still working.

a separate branch was created from this repository for each dataset, including the dataset itself, 
the EDA notebook, the cleaned version of the dataset, and the modeling notebook.
